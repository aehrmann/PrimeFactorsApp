# Prime Factors app for iOS

This project is a simple prime factors generator, used as an exercise in 
test-driven iOS development. Together, [Lisa Hamm](http://www.lisahamm.com/)
and I pair-programmed the app using the [Quick](https://github.com/Quick/Quick)
unit testing framework and [Nimble](https://github.com/Quick/Nimble), it's associated matcher library.


## Here's how to get it running:

#### Initial Setup
	1. Clone repo 
	2. Run `bundle install` to install Cocoapods
		- Install `bundler` via Rubygems if not installed
	3. Run `pod install` to install Quick and Nimble (testing dependencies)

#### Running tests
	After opening PrimeFactorsApp.xcworkspace in XCode:
		select Product > Test (or Cmd-U) from the application menu

### Version Information
